In today's competitive landscape, effective sales management is crucial for businesses striving to reduce costs and increase profitability. That's why I embarked on a comprehensive Analytics project focusing on Amazon sales data. Leveraging ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) and Power BI techniques, I extracted invaluable insights to drive strategic decision-making.

🔍 Problem Statement:
Sales management has emerged as the cornerstone of commercial enterprises, essential for navigating market competition and optimizing distribution channels. To address this, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Amazon sales data to uncover sales trends, identify key metrics, and establish meaningful relationships between attributes.
